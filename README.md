# INF 554 Assignment for 5

SLIDE 1. INTRODUCTION

	Introducing ourselves

SLIDE 2. DESCRIPTION ABOUT PROJECT (PROBELM)
	
	Planning travel is hard. Sometimes we have a place in mind but don't know the right time to visit it. Sometimes we know when we have to plan a holiday but no proper destination in mind. How do we solve this problem ? How do we know a best vacation destination and perfect time to visit it? 
	
SLIDE 3. DESCRIPTION ABOUT PROJECT (SOLUTION)
	
	Our aim is to create a visualization tool for all the travelers which gives them a comparable holiday destination and best airline to travel with based on our analysis on air traffic, air fare and airline ranking data.
	
SLIDE 4. WHEN TO FLY
	
	Suppose you are planning for winter break holiday but havn't decided on place. Our project will provide you with visual statistics on top 25 countries to visit during that period. 
	
SLIDE 5. WHERE TO FLY

	Now suppose you have a destination but aren't sure about the best time to visit that place. Our project will help you decide best time based on our analysis on lowest air fare and the trends of number of people visiting that destination throughout the year. 

SLIDE 6. WHOM TO FLY WITH

	For most travelers, air travel has become a constant struggle to avoid ultra-tight seating, hefty luggage fees, and itinerary-wrecking delays. We provide best and worst airline to travel with based on our airline ranking statistics.

SLIDE 7. HOW DO WE DO THIS
	
	We take insights from our data analysis. As we can see in image we observe Top 25 countries visited in December by travelers from Los Angeles. We see that Mexico is highy visited we also noticed that we can see in Mexico, CanCun is visited by most of the travelers. We can also look air fare trends from Los Angeles to CanCun. 
	
SLIDE 8. COMPARISON WITH OTHERS

	Everyone is interested in analysing air traffic for investigating best flight routes, reducing air traffic congestion. Air traffic is never analysed in suggesting the most visited destination and the best time to visit it. We analyse these trends in our project unlike others.
	
SLIDE 9. AUDIENCE 

	Our audience is anyone who wants to travel or is planning on to travel with no destination in mind or someone wishing to save bucks on airfare. Anyone that is interested in travelling, young professionals, business owners, teachers, students, etc.

SLIDE 10. USER INTERACTION 

	We do know every end user might have different needs. To cater to those needs we plan to provide user with lots on user interaction. We plan to provide information tool tips so that user don't have to stress through visualizations to read them.

SLIDE 11. DATA AND DATA SOURCE

	We are using three datasets for our project. We have collected data on Air Traffic inbound and outbound to US and air fair from a source to destination from Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Data on airline ranking having parameters like punctuality, service quality, handling of passenger score is collected from data.world. 

SLIDE 12. DELIVERABLES
	
	At the end of this project we will have fully functional web application for travelers guiding them on their holidays. Web application will be simple and user friendly which will solve mentioned problem consistently and uniformly.

SLIDE 13. TECHNOLOGIES

	For our web architecture we are using React frontend with Node.js backend. We might change this to Django backend.
	Flow will be like:
	1. Client sending request to get some JSX template page
	2. Node.js/Django server getting main file containing JSX code.
	3. Rendering it to plain HTML code.
	4. Sending HTML response to client.

SLIDE 14. TIMELINE

	We plan to complete research on data and its formatting by September. In October we will start with paper prototype, constructing and refining design and deploying components. In November we will work on Final Paper, interactivity across components, Final Video & Website and Presentation.

SLIDE 15. FUTURE WORK

	With proper data and time available we can also show past trends on hotel prices to travelers helping them decide where to stay, how to fly, what to do and where to eat. We also plan to compare hotel prices so travelers can find the lowest price on hotel's as well.
