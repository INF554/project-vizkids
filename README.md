There is immense growth in travellers around the world. The statistics shows that the number of tourist worldwide increased from 1996 to 2017. In 2017, the estimated number of international tourist worldwide was approximately 1.32 billion. Travel and tourism made 8.27 trillion U.S. dollars to the global economy in 2017. 
By observing that how tourism is becoming one of the important economic factor of the world providing benefits to both departure and arrival countries, we aimed at improving the 
Way people plan travel. We served visualizations by observing data throughout ten years and scrutinizing them with interactive options user can plan their travel in no hassle.
Our aim is to create a visualization tool for all the travelers which gives them a comparable holiday destination, best time to visit it and best airline to travel with based on our analysis on air traffic, air fare and airline ranking data.
